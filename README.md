# Diabetes-Python-Machine-Learning
Diabetes is a health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.  Without ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a buildup of sugars in the blood, which can increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease. So that i decide to predict using Machine Learning in Python.  
Objectives:  Predict if person is diabetes patient or not Find most indicative features of diabetes Try different classification methods to find highest accuracy  In this project, I will use python and Jupyter notebook. I will go through the project by importing the dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis to get insights and understanding on how the dataset looks like and then build the model. I used Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and XGBoost.  
Yufeng Guo, in his article The 7 Steps of Machine Learning, provides the following general framework of steps in supervised machine learning; 
Data Collection 
Data Preparation 
Choosing a model Training the model 
Evaluating the model 
Parameter tuning 
Making prediction
